# Portfolio
This is my second project in the Front End Web Development nanodegree at Udacity. Reviewed and approved winter 2017.

I was provided a design mockup and replicated the design in HTML and CSS. I've developed a responsive website that display images, descriptions and links to two of the projects
I've completed throughout the course this far.
